(* One_matrix is the 1-dimendsional implementation of the game of life. The
   gameboard is a one dimensional array, which updates on each generation. It
   can be stylized as as a 2D gird, however. Due to the nature of each node only
   having three neighbors, there are 8 possible outcomes of which a rule can be
   composed. As such there are 255 rules, some more interesting than others.
   This implementation allows the user to choose their rule, and to run
   generations and see the pattern develop. *)
