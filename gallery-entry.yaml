  Our project works within the field of Cellular Automata. Inspired by the famous Rule 90 and John Conway's Game of Life, we have implemented various systems of cellular automata, allowing interactivity by changing parameters and adding rules. For example, we have implemented both 2D and 1D cellular automata with various gamerule parameters. These automata can be observed through either the command line or through a GUI.
