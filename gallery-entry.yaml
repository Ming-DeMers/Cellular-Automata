  Our project works within the field of Cellular Automata. Inspired by the famous Rule 90 and John Conway's Game of Life, we intend to implement systems of cellular automata, and allow interactivity by changing parameters and adding rules. For example, we have already implemented 2D cellular automata, demo'd above, but hope to implment 1D CA and even 3D CA. Other variations come from adding more states beyond alive and dead (i.e. killer cells, protector cells), allows values to represent color (i.e. 255 = RGB), and possibly neural networks and machine learning for regenerative and mutating CA.

  We hope to extend this project by using it to model real-world phoenomena. There are patterns such as the fibonacci sequence which have been modeled in CA already, but we hope to perhaps investigate ideas of population growth, urban decay, forest fires, etc.
  
  The project will largely be CLI-based. We may implement a GUI, but understand much of program functionality can be reached with the CL.
