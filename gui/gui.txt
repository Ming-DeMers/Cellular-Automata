1) Ensure `open_graph ""` opens a window
2) semicolons to separate following commands:
  a) open_graph " 400x600";
  b) set_window_title "Conway's Game of Life";
  c) set_color white;
  d) display_mode true;
  e) draw_grid grid;
  f) while true do 
    a) let g = step grid in (check if this works in continual stepping, if not use refs or something) 
       clear_graph ();
       draw_grid g;
       Unix.sleep 2;
    (* pause the loop for 2 seconds before displaying the new, stepped
       gameboard *)
       let key = read_key () in
       match key with
        | 'q' -> exit 0
        | _ -> ()
      
When opening in utop, run these commands:

#require "graphics";;
open Graphics;;
open Cellular_automata.Two;;
then here you can run the commands, but have to open_graph " width*height";;
