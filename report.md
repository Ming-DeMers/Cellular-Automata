# OCHamleon MS2 Report:
>## Vision:
In one paragraph, what is your current vision for the system you are building? How has it evolved from previous plans? It's okay for you to make changes, even big ones.

>## Summary of progress:
Write a one or two paragraph description of what your team accomplished between MS1 and MS2. What functionality did you work on?

>## Activity breakdown: 
For each team member, give a bulleted list of the responsibilities that team member had, the activities in which they participated, the features they delivered, and the number of hours they spent working.

>## Productivity analysis: 
As an entire team, how productive were you? Did you accomplish what you planned in your sprints? Were your estimates of what you could do accurate, or far off? Write a paragraph addressing those questions. Please be honest: we want you to reflect candidly on your progress, so that you can make more accurate estimates between MS2 and MS3. Your grade is not going to be based on how positive or negative you are here.
