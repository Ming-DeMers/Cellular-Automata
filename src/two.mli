(* two_matrix is the 2 dimensional implementation of the Game of Life. The game
   is represented in a 2D that updates upon each generation. Each node has 8
   neighbors, which affects whether it lives or dies on the next round. This
   implementation allows the user to generate preset patterns or input their own
   manually, and run the pattern for generations. *)
